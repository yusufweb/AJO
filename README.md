# Ajo: Modern Rotating Savings Platform

**Empowering communities through digital financial inclusion.**

Digital Ajo is a modern, web-based platform that digitizes the traditional African cooperative savings system, commonly known as **Ajo**, **Esusu**, or **Adashi**. It allows groups of people to contribute money periodically and receive the entire lump sum payout in turns, bringing unparalleled levels of **trust, automation, and transparency** to a time-tested community practice.
